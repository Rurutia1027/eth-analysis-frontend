# The Mrege (Transition to PoS)

### Date: Sep. 15th, 2022 
### Purpose: Shifted Ethereum from Proof-of-Work(PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
### Key Changes: 
- Merged Ethereum's **execution layer (Mainnet)** with the **consensus layer(Beacon Chain)**.
- Eliminated mining, reducing energy consumption by ~99.95%. 
- Introduced **staking**, requiring validators to lock up ETH to secure the network. 
- **Change ETH issuance**, making it more deflationary, especially with EIP-1559's burn mechanism.
