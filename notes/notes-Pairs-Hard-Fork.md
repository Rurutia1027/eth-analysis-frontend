# Pairs Hard Fork 

**The Merge** is sometimes referred to as the **Pairs Hard Fork**, but the naming is based on the two components of the transitions: 

### Bellatrix Upgrade (Consensus Layer Update)
- Occured on **September 6, 2022. **
- Upgraded the **Beacon Chain** (Proof-of-Stake consensus layer) to prepare for The Merge. 

### Pairs Hard Fork (Execution Layer Update)
- Occured on **September 15, 2022.**
- Triggered when **Terminal Total Difficulty(TTD) was reached**, repalcing **Proof-of-Work(PoW)** with **Proof-of-Stake(PoS)** on Ethereum's **execution layer**.
- This was the moment Ethereum **stopped using miners** and fully transitioned to **PoS**.  

### Conclusion

- So **The Merge** = **Bellatrix(Beacon Chain)** + **Pair (Execution layer switch to PoS)**. 
- In this project we called the time period **since_merge** = [pairs_hard_fork, now) as a time frame.
